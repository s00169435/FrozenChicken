        <p>"Frozen Chicken" is a single man project lead by me. The main purpose of this project is to submit a fully functioning game for my Simulated Work Placement module using the skills I have 
            gained throughout my course but it has also provided me the opportunity to actually make a game in my own image. After iterating through several ideas and different types of 
            games, I finally settled on making a game with a very simple design but fun and kind of unique. Frozen Chicken is about a dilemma that we all face when we'd rather do 
            something much more fun and appealing but are left with the ultimatum of choosing between what we'd rather do and what we have to do. That dilemma is procrastination. You, 
            the player, are a child home alone. You have been given a list of chores by your parents to be completed before they arrive back home. However, all thse chores are SUPER
            boring and there's so much more fun things to do. Before you do any of the listed chores, you must first satisfy yourself with some games, music, naps etc. Then maybe, just 
            maybe, you might be willing to do these chores.</p>
            <p>This blog is also made by me for the purpose of recording progression of the game's development. I haven't used HTML in a while and consequentally, my web design skills 
                have worsened. Expect a shoddy looking website.</p>
