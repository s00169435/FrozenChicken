                <p>Finally got around to working on the dog AI. It's basically the same script as what I have used for the player tile movements but tweeked so that it's automatic and moving
                    on its own like an AI should. It's not completely fleshed out. For starters, the dog will continuously walk about the map without pause, which isn't like any dog I know of. 
                    Going to make adjustments later so that the dog stays in place momentarily before walking again. The dog will later on also poop all over the house, which the player will
                    have to clean up. Gonna work on the dog a bit more I guess.

                <p>This is my first proper entry into the blog. I had to take some HTML and CSS tutorials because I had forgotten the basic syntax and elements in html. The page will look ugly for a while.
                    It isn't an immediate priootiy for this to look appealing, just a way to log progresssion for the game's development. Anyway, here's the first ever post. Enjoy.
