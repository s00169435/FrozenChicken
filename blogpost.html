                <p>Programmed the dog to poop within a certain interval of time. The poops will slow down the player if 
                    they come in contact withone another. Need to also fine tune how the poops spawn into the world.
                    Right now, they spawn at the exact location of the dog at the given moment but I want them to be
                    situated just above the center of a tile. There's also the chance that multiple poops might spawn on 
                    top of each other, so I need to check first if there is already a poop on the targeted tile.

                <p>A showcase of how the player movement system works. It's triggered by a mouse click on an onoccupied tile. Using the node positions on the selected tile and 
                    the BreathFirstSearch algorithm, the system will look for the shortest path to that selected tile. I'm gonna later adjust it so that it won't go on tiles that
                    are marked as "unavailable" and maybe add a little icon above the selected node, so that the player will always know where they are going. The player's speed is 
                    also affected by obstacles in the way, so they will be slowed down if they're not careful about their movement.

                <p>Finally got around to working on the dog AI. It's basically the same script as what I have used for the player tile movements but tweeked so that it's automatic and moving
                    on its own like an AI should. It's not completely fleshed out. For starters, the dog will continuously walk about the map without pause, which isn't like any dog I know of. 
                    Going to make adjustments later so that the dog stays in place momentarily before walking again. The dog will later on also poop all over the house, which the player will
                    have to clean up. Gonna work on the dog a bit more I guess.

                <p>This is my first proper entry into the blog. I had to take some HTML and CSS tutorials because I had forgotten the basic syntax and elements in html. The page will look ugly for a while.
                    It isn't an immediate priootiy for this to look appealing, just a way to log progresssion for the game's development. Anyway, here's the first ever post. Enjoy.
